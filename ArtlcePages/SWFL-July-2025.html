    <h1>July 2025 SWFL Housing Market: Bonita-Estero vs Naples vs Fort Myers</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p class="byline"><em>Author: Bonita Springs-Estero REALTORS® • Published 2025-08-14</em></p>

    <p><em>Southwest Florida’s housing market in July 2025 shows significantly higher inventory compared to the frenzied market of 2021. Buyers have more options as supply rises, while prices have leveled off or dipped slightly from last year’s highs. Below we compare key market trends in Bonita Springs-Estero, Naples, and Fort Myers, with a focus on the surge in homes for sale and what it means for buyers and sellers.</em></p>

    <h2>Inventory surge and market balance</h2>
    <p>The most striking trend across all three areas is the sharp increase in inventory since 2021. After the record-low supply of homes during the 2021 boom, the number of homes for sale has rebounded markedly. Months’ supply of inventory – which hovered around 1 month or less in mid-2021 – has now climbed into the mid-single digits or higher by 2025, indicating a transition toward a more balanced market.</p>

    </figure>

    <p><strong>Prices have stabilized or softened.</strong> Naples’ median price held at about <strong>$570,000</strong> year over year, signaling resilience. Bonita Springs-Estero’s median eased to <strong>$495,000</strong> (-11.6% YoY), and Fort Myers dipped to <strong>$335,000</strong> (-8.2% YoY). These modest retreats follow the dramatic run-up of 2021–2022.</p>

      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Months’ supply rose from ~1 month in 2021 to 5–7 months in 2025, reflecting a balanced market.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p><strong>More homes for sale are creating a balanced market.</strong> Bonita Springs-Estero is near <strong>5 months’ supply</strong>, while Naples and Fort Myers sit around <strong>6–7 months</strong>. Buyers can take a bit more time and negotiate; sellers must price competitively and prepare for longer marketing times than in 2021–2022.</p>

    <h2>Regional highlights: July 2025 vs July 2024</h2>
    <p>While all three areas share rising inventory, each has unique nuances. The infographics summarize year-over-year changes.</p>

        <img src="https://bonitaesterorealtors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/44.png" alt="Fort Myers July 2025 market snapshot" />
        <figcaption><strong>Fort Myers:</strong> Median <strong>$335K</strong> (-8.2% YoY), pending +11%, homes for sale +17%, new listings -3.8%.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>In <strong>Bonita Springs-Estero</strong>, price adjustments helped unlock demand. Closed sales rose 18% and pending sales jumped 36.5% year over year as buyers responded to better affordability and more selection. Inventory increased more than 20%, keeping conditions near balanced and stretching marketing times to roughly three months.</p>

    <p><strong>Naples</strong> remained resilient. The median price held flat at $570,000 despite higher inventory, suggesting ample demand from cash and luxury buyers. Pending sales climbed nearly 24%; closed sales were flat, indicating steady absorption of new supply even during the slower summer season.</p>

    <p>In <strong>Fort Myers</strong>, higher rates weighed more on pricing, pushing the median down 8.2% to $335,000. Closed sales fell 5.4% YoY, although pending sales still improved 11%. Fewer new listings arrived, yet total active inventory rose 17%, implying slower turnover and the need for sharper pricing.</p>

    <h2>What this means for buyers and sellers</h2>
    <p><strong>Buyers:</strong> You finally have choices again. Use the higher supply to compare neighborhoods, insist on full disclosures, and negotiate repairs or credits. Move quickly on well-priced homes – especially updated properties in prime locations – as they still attract multiple showings.</p>

    <p><strong>Sellers:</strong> Competition is back. Pricing to the most recent comparable sales, correcting condition issues, and investing in professional presentation matter more now. Expect fewer bidding wars and longer days on market than in 2021–2022, but know that motivated buyers are active across Southwest Florida.</p>

    <p><em>Overall, July 2025 marks a return to normalcy across Bonita Springs-Estero, Naples, and Fort Myers. Inventory is higher, prices are steady to slightly lower, and both sides of the table have workable paths to success.</em></p>
