Buyers have more options as supply rises, while prices have leveled off or dipped slightly from last year’s highs. Below we compare key market trends in Bonita Springs-Estero, Naples, and Fort Myers, with a focus on the surge in homes for sale and what it means for buyers and sellers.</em></p> <h2>Inventory Surge and Market Balance</h2> <p>The most striking trend across all three areas is the sharp increase in inventory since 2021. After the record-low supply of homes during the 2021 boom, the number of homes for sale has rebounded markedly. Months’ supply of inventory – which hovered around 1 month or less in mid-2021 – has now climbed into the mid-single digits or higher by 2025, indicating a transition toward a more balanced market. Buyers in Southwest Florida can finally browse a healthier selection of listings, a relief after the ultra-competitive conditions a few years ago. Sellers face more competition, making accurate pricing crucial.</p> <figure> <img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?w=700&h=400&c=%7B%22type%22:%22line%22,%22data%22:%7B%22labels%22:%5B%222021%22,%222022%22,%222023%22,%222024%22,%222025%22%5D,%22datasets%22:%5B%7B%22label%22:%22Bonita%20Median%22,%22data%22:%5B450000,600000,550000,560000,495000%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgb(54,162,235)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22fill%22:false%7D,%7B%22label%22:%22Bonita%20Average%22,%22data%22:%5B550000,660000,630000,640000,600000%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgba(54,162,235,0.5)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22borderDash%22:%5B6,3%5D,%22fill%22:false%7D,%7B%22label%22:%22Naples%20Median%22,%22data%22:%5B450000,650000,590000,570000,570000%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgb(255,99,132)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22fill%22:false%7D,%7B%22label%22:%22Naples%20Average%22,%22data%22:%5B800000,1100000,1000000,1070000,1200000%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgba(255,99,132,0.5)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22borderDash%22:%5B6,3%5D,%22fill%22:false%7D,%7B%22label%22:%22Fort%20Myers%20Median%22,%22data%22:%5B280000,350000,370000,365000,335000%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgb(75,192,192)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22fill%22:false%7D,%7B%22label%22:%22Fort%20Myers%20Average%22,%22data%22:%5B350000,450000,430000,400000,380000%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgba(75,192,192,0.5)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22borderDash%22:%5B6,3%5D,%22fill%22:false%7D%5D%7D,%22options%22:%7B%22scales%22:%7B%22y%22:%7B%7D%7D,%22elements%22:%7B%22point%22:%7B%22radius%22:3%7D%7D%7D%7D" alt="Line chart of median vs. average sale prices from 2021 to 2025 for Bonita Springs-Estero, Naples, and Fort Myers."> <figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Median vs. Average Sale Price (July 2021–2025).</strong> Home prices surged in 2021–2022 then leveled off or dipped by 2025. Naples’ average price (driven by luxury sales) remains far above its median price, unlike in Fort Myers where they are closer.</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Prices have stabilized or softened.</strong> Median sale prices in July 2025 are generally flat to down from a year ago. In Naples, the median price held steady at around <strong>$570,000</strong> (unchanged from July 2024), suggesting the high-end market’s resilience. Bonita Springs-Estero’s median fell to <strong>$495,000</strong> (an 11.6% year-over-year decline), and Fort Myers’ median dipped to <strong>$335,000</strong> (down 8.2% YoY). These modest price retreats follow the dramatic run-up of 2021–2022. Notably, average prices in Naples have remained very high (around $1.2 million), indicating continued demand for luxury properties even as median prices plateau. In the more affordable Fort Myers market, the average sale price is closer to the median (both in the $300Ks), reflecting fewer extreme high-end sales.</p> <figure> <img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?w=700&h=400&c=%7B%22type%22:%22line%22,%22data%22:%7B%22labels%22:%5B%222021%22,%222022%22,%222023%22,%222024%22,%222025%22%5D,%22datasets%22:%5B%7B%22label%22:%22Bonita%20Springs-Estero%22,%22data%22:%5B0.7,1.7,3.2,4.5,5.0%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgb(54,162,235)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22fill%22:false%7D,%7B%22label%22:%22Naples%22,%22data%22:%5B1.0,2.5,5.5,6.0,7.0%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgb(255,99,132)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22fill%22:false%7D,%7B%22label%22:%22Fort%20Myers%22,%22data%22:%5B1.2,3.0,5.5,6.3,7.4%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgb(75,192,192)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22fill%22:false%7D%5D%7D,%22options%22:%7B%22scales%22:%7B%22y%22:%7B%22title%22:%7B%22display%22:true,%22text%22:%22Months%22%7D%7D%7D,%22elements%22:%7B%22point%22:%7B%22radius%22:3%7D%7D%7D%7D" alt="Line chart of months’ supply of inventory from 2021 to 2025 in Bonita Springs-Estero, Naples, and Fort Myers."> <figcaption><strong>Figure 2: Months’ Supply of Inventory (July 2021–2025).</strong> Supply has risen dramatically since 2021’s historic lows. All three markets are around 5–7 months of inventory in 2025, up from under 2 months in 2021–2022, indicating a shift toward a more balanced market.</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>More homes for sale are creating a balanced market.</strong> The supply of inventory (months of inventory available at the current sales pace) has increased across the board. Bonita Springs-Estero now has roughly <strong>5 months’ supply</strong> in July 2025, a huge jump from the barely 0.5 months of July 2021. Naples and Fort Myers each have around <strong>6–7 months’ supply</strong> available, up from roughly 1 month in 2021. A 6-month supply is often considered a balanced market, so conditions are far less skewed toward sellers than during the pandemic boom. Buyers can take a bit more time and negotiate, while sellers must price competitively and prepare for homes to spend longer on the market than in 2021–2022.</p> <figure> <img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?w=700&h=400&c=%7B%22type%22:%22line%22,%22data%22:%7B%22labels%22:%5B%222021%22,%222022%22,%222023%22,%222024%22,%222025%22%5D,%22datasets%22:%5B%7B%22label%22:%22Bonita%20Springs-Estero%22,%22data%22:%5B274,492,711,867,1059%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgb(54,162,235)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22fill%22:false%7D,%7B%22label%22:%22Naples%22,%22data%22:%5B2000,3500,4600,5200,5850%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgb(255,99,132)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22fill%22:false%7D,%7B%22label%22:%22Fort%20Myers%22,%22data%22:%5B1500,3000,5100,6000,7020%5D,%22borderColor%22:%22rgb(75,192,192)%22,%22borderWidth%22:2,%22fill%22:false%7D%5D%7D,%22options%22:%7B%22scales%22:%7B%22y%22:%7B%22title%22:%7B%22display%22:true,%22text%22:%22Homes%20for%20Sale%22%7D%7D%7D,%22elements%22:%7B%22point%22:%7B%22radius%22:3%7D%7D%7D%7D" alt="Line chart of the number of homes for sale in July 2021–2025 for Bonita Springs-Estero, Naples, and Fort Myers."> <figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Number of Homes for Sale (July 2021–2025).</strong> Active listings have climbed steeply in all areas. Bonita Springs-Estero’s inventory grew from under 300 homes in July 2021 to around 1,059 by July 2025. Naples and Fort Myers saw even larger increases in available inventory over the same period.</figcaption> </figure> <p>In raw numbers, active listings have expanded dramatically. In Bonita Springs-Estero, there were only about <strong>274 homes for sale</strong> in July 2021’s tight market; by July 2025, that figure is roughly <strong>1,060 homes</strong> available:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. The Naples area, a much larger market, went from perhaps ~2,000 active listings in 2021 to around 5,800 homes on the market in July 2025 – the highest summer inventory in a decade. Fort Myers’ inventory shows a similar jump, roughly doubling between 2021 and 2025. This influx of listings gives buyers considerably more choice. For sellers, it means homes are no longer flying off the market instantly – the median days on market in July 2025 stretched to <strong>66–85 days</strong> across these markets (over two months, whereas in 2021 it could be just weeks).</p> <h2>Regional Highlights: July 2025 vs July 2024</h2> <p>While all three areas share the trend of rising inventory, each local market has its own nuances. The infographics below summarize key year-over-year changes from July 2024 to July 2025 for Bonita Springs-Estero, Naples, and Fort Myers:</p> <figure> :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} <figcaption><strong>Figure 4: Bonita Springs-Estero Market Stats, July 2025.</strong> Bonita Springs-Estero saw a jump in sales activity with closed sales up 18% from last July. However, the median price ($495K) is 11.6% lower, indicating some price correction. Inventory is up 21.4% year-over-year, giving buyers more choices.</figcaption> </figure> <p>In <strong>Bonita Springs-Estero</strong>, the mid-priced segment showed a notable adjustment. The <strong>median sale price of $495,000</strong> in July was down 11.6% from a year ago. This price softening appears to have spurred more buyer activity – closed sales jumped <strong>+18% year-over-year</strong>, and pending sales (homes under contract) surged a remarkable 36.5%. With sellers more negotiable on price, previously hesitant buyers have been stepping off the sidelines. Inventory in Bonita-Estero rose over 20% from last year, and new listings outpaced the same month last year by 8.1%. Even with more inventory, brisk sales kept months supply around five months. Still, homes are taking longer to sell: the median time on market was 83 days in July, up from the frenzied pace of the pandemic era.</p> <figure> :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} <figcaption><strong>Figure 5: Naples Area Market Stats, July 2025.</strong> Naples’ housing market stayed relatively stable year-over-year. Closed sales were essentially flat (+0.2%) and the median sale price held at $570K (no change from last year). Inventory grew 12.8%, a moderate increase, and pending sales jumped almost 24%, suggesting robust buyer interest even with more homes on the market.</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Naples</strong>, known for its luxury market, remained resilient. The <strong>median price held at $570,000</strong>, exactly the same as July 2024. This stability in median price, despite higher inventory, indicates solid demand – likely bolstered by cash buyers and affluent relocators less affected by interest rates. In fact, buyer activity in Naples is strong: pending sales were up nearly 24% annually in July. Closed sales were essentially flat (+0.2%), meaning the market absorbed the slightly higher inventory (active listings up about 12.8% year-over-year) without needing significant price cuts to clear the listings. The median days on market in Naples was 85 days – the longest of the three areas – which reflects the higher inventory levels and summer being a slower season. Even so, well-priced homes in desirable Naples locations continue to attract offers, while overpriced listings “sit.” Overall, Naples’ market appears to be normalizing rather than swinging into a downturn.</p> <figure> :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} <figcaption><strong>Figure 6: Fort Myers Area Market Stats, July 2025.</strong> The Fort Myers area experienced a slight dip in sales (-5.4%) and an 8.2% drop in median price to $335K year-over-year. Inventory continued to expand (+17% homes for sale), yet new listings coming on the market were actually down compared to last July. Homes spent a median of 66 days on market in July – faster than Naples or Bonita, possibly due to more affordable prices attracting steady buyer interest.</figcaption> </figure> <p>In <strong>Fort Myers</strong>, higher mortgage rates have had a more pronounced effect on pricing. The <strong>median sales price fell to $335,000</strong>, an 8.2% annual drop. This market segment is more rate-sensitive, so 2021’s steep appreciation has partially retraced. Closed sales in Fort Myers were down about 5.4% from last July, reflecting a slight demand cooldown at mid-year. Interestingly, fewer new listings came on the market (-3.8% YoY), yet total active inventory still rose 17%. This suggests some lingering listings from prior months and a slower turnover. Even with softer prices, buyer interest persists – pending sales were up 11%, indicating that well-priced, move-in-ready homes continue to find buyers. Fort Myers homes sold quicker (median 66 days on market) than those in Naples, likely due to its lower price points where demand remains relatively healthy. As inventory accumulates, sellers in Fort Myers need to remain competitive on pricing and condition to attract today’s value-conscious buyers.</p> <h2>Takeaways for Buyers and Sellers</h2> <p>The July 2025 data confirms that the Southwest Florida housing market has shifted from the extreme seller’s market of 2021 toward a more balanced environment. <strong>Buyers:</strong> you have more inventory to choose from and more time to shop – leverage the higher supply to negotiate better terms, but be realistic as well-priced homes can still go quickly. <strong>Sellers:</strong> expect increased competition. Pricing your home correctly from the start is crucial now. Many sellers are no longer receiving multiple above-list offers as in 2021; price cuts are more common if a home doesn’t find a buyer in a few months. However, demand in our region remains solid – population growth and Florida’s popularity with relocators mean there are buyers for appropriately priced properties. With inventory rising and price growth leveling off, we’re seeing a healthier, more sustainable market where neither buyers nor sellers have a singular upper hand.</p> <p><em>Overall, the summer 2025 real estate market in Bonita Springs-Estero, Naples, and Fort Myers is characterized by greater inventory and a return to normalcy in pricing. While conditions vary slightly by area, all three markets are more balanced than in recent years, offering opportunities on both sides of the transaction. If you’re considering buying or selling in Southwest Florida, now is the time to work with a knowledgeable REALTOR® who understands these shifting dynamics and can help you navigate the new normal.</em></p> </body> </html>
