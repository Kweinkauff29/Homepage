We are reaching out regarding your Sales Excellence Awards application. Our records indicate that your verified sales amount is ${formattedVerifiedAmt}. Based on this figure, you are not currently eligible for an award.

If you are certain you are eligible for the applied level, please take the following actions:

1. <strong>Team Sales:</strong> If you are part of a team, please reply to this email indicating the team member(s) with whom you are sharing your sales and ensure they are CC'd for verification.  We will take the totals and divide them.
2. <strong>Off-Market Sales:</strong> If you have off-market sales (e.g., New Construction or FSBO), please follow the instructions via the link here <a href="https://scribehow.com/shared/How_to_Submit_a_Residential_Comp_Sold_Listing__qb9PpgJFQbmtGaBgBzUIeA" target="_blank">Scribe Link</a>. Alternatively, if you believe some sales have not been credited correctly, please send us the relevant Settlement Statements and MLS numbers so we can update our records.

Please note that failure to respond by <strong>February 19th</strong> may result in you not receiving an award.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Bonita Springs-Estero Realtors`;
